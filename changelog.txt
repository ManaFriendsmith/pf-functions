Version: 1.0.0
  Info:
    - Initial release.
    - Broke out functions shared across BrassTacks etc. into their own mod, for ease of maintenance.
    - Consolidated difficulty settings from BrassTacks etc. into a single option. Apologies for the loss of granularity.
    - Rewrote functions for compatibility with factorio 2.0/SpaceAge and to make them generally more flexible.
