planetfall-difficulty=Global complexity setting for planetfall resource mods.\n\n[color=blue]Minimal:[/color] Adds a relatively small number of intermediates. Limited crafting trees outside of resource processing. Comparable per-mod complexity to easier BZ mods.\n[color=blue]Moderate:[/color] Adds even more intermediates. You might find this more flavorful, or just tedious, depending on how you feel about base-game abstractions like "all moving parts are gears." Comparable per-mod complexity to where the mods were before. In Space Age, some intermediates are pushed after the rocket launch.\n[color=blue]Maximal:[/color] Even more fiddly doohickies to craft than before. Some recipes are more expensive.
planetfall-reorganize-crafting-menu=Moves things around in the crafting/selection menu in a way that is cleaner and more intuitive for me, but might not be for you. Will definitely make menus messier when used with unsupported mods.
